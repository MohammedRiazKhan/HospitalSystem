# HospitalSystem

The aim of the system with which I am solving this me.mohammedriaz.domain, is to assist doctors as well as nursing staff, 
to better manage their day to day operations with the use of a hospital system. 

## What will the system do?

- As a doctor/nurse, the user will be able to create/manage patients, their appointments, visits and medication prescriptions
  and dispensary
- Will be able to store patients records and retrieve them when needed.
- Be able to generate Patient reports
- Allow team members Doctors and Nurses who are caring for a patientId to have up to date information on their patients.
- Keep track of any information pertaining to the hospital and possibly link up to a larger hospital system.
